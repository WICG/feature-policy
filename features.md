# Policy Controlled Features

This document lists policy-controlled features being implemented in browsers. It
is broken into sections based on the standardization state of each feature. The
names used here should be consistent between browsers implementing a particular
feature, but there is no requirement that all browsers implement any single
feature.

The exact definition of the behaviour controlled by each feature belongs in the
spec which defines the feature. Those are linked where available.

## Standardized Features

These features have been declared in a published version of the respective
specification.

## Notes

<a name="fn1">[1]</a>: To enable these, use the Chrome command line flag
`--enable-blink-features=ExperimentalProductivityFeatures`.

<a name="fn2">[2]</a>: Currently implemented in Chrome as `vr`.

<a name="fn3">[3]</a>: This represents a number of features. Individual feature
names will be added to this list as they are actually defined.

<a name="fn4">[4]</a>: To enable this, use the Chrome command line flag
`--enable-blink-features=Serial`.

<a name="fn5">[5]</a>: The earlier version of this feature ([`lazyload`](policies/lazyload.md)) is available behind a flag in Chrome<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>.
